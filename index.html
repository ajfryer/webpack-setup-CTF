          Crypto Trend Following is an investment strategy inspired by large hedge funds. It seeks to protect capital in bear markets, take profits during bull markets, and avoid black swans that make many coins worthless.<br>

            HODL isn't for everyone.<br>
            At least not for 100% of your portfolio.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Do you want to invest in cryptocurrency, but don't like the idea of gambling on coins that may boom or completely bust? (See <a href="https://deadcoins.com/">deadcoins.com</a>)
          </p>
          <p>
            Trend following bets aggressively when markets are stable and trending and conservatively when markets are volatile and choppy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe Trend Following can be an "all-weather" way to invest in crypto. It is designed for modest returns across bull and bear markets and to survive black swan events that kill many coins.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              If you want a risk-management-first way to invest in high-risk cryptocurrencies, it's worth considering diversifying your crypto portfolio with Trend Following!

              Large commodity & currency funds<br>
              have trend followed for decades.

            <p>
              Everyday, funds managing billions of dollars use diversified trend following strategies to trade all four major asset classes (stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities). 
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's how they work: 
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                the fund managers select a diversified universe of markets to trade from.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each day, the fund rebalances. More money into markets with stable trends and less into markets with volatile non-trends.
              </li>
              <li>
                Over time, the fund ends up betting heavily on the best trends, while actively avoiding sideways markets and markets going bust!

            How does this site work?
          </h2>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Click Get Started</h3>
          <p>
            Crypto Trend Following is a free site that calculates how much crypto you should own in order to follow a Trend Following Strategy. We are not financial advisers and don't make any trades for you, but we provide the information on this site free of charge. Click Get Started to configure your own strategy.
          </p>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Easy Customization</h3>
          <p>
            Once you click Get Stated, you'll notice there's a couple different kinds of Trend Following. Choose the level of "Trend Speed", "volatility", "leverage", and "shorting", to match your situation. If you aren't sure what to choose, click the "Starter Strategy" button to get a standard strategy without having to customize.
          </p>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Great as a Diversifier, too!</h3>
          <p>
            Here's the thing: you don't have to put 100% of your cryptocurrency portfolio in Trend Following. Trend Following on a wide variety of coins can help diversify a portfolio of other strategies (like HODL, arbitrage, etc.) Add as little or as much Trend Following on as many different coins as you want.
